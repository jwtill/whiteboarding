//! Question #3: Compressing Strings
// Write an algorithm that takes a string with repeated characters and compresses them, using a number to show how many times the repeated character has been compressed. 
// For instance, aaa would be written as 3a. 
// Solve the problem with and without recursion.

// Example
// Input: "aaabccdddda"

// Output: "3ab2c4da"
// while loop? split? splice?

function compress(str) {
  arr = str.split("");
  for(let i = 0; i<str.length; i++) {
    for(let j = 0; j < str.length; j++) {
      if()
    }
  }

}


for (let i =0; i<frog.length; i++) {
  if (frog[i] === frog[i+1]) {
      counter ++;
      dogs = counter + frog[i];
  }
}
